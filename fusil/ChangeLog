Changelog
=========

Fusil 1.2.2
-----------

 * Create fusil-gimp
 * Remove charset from WriteCode: use builtin open() instead codecs.open()
   because files created by open() are much faster
 * Optimize FileWatch: don't recompile patterns at each session
 * fusil now depends on python-ptrace 0.6
 * Don't use close_fds argument of subprocess.Popen() on Windows
 * Fix configuration reader: normal_calm_load, normal_calm_sleep,
   slow_calm_load, slow_calm_sleep keys global options are float, not integer

Fusil 1.2.1 (2009-02-06)
------------------------

 * Fix mangle agent of the Image Magick fuzzer
 * Fix AttachProcessPID() probe: stop the probe at process exit

Fusil 1.2 (2009-02-04)
----------------------

User visible changes:

 * Fusil now requires Python 2.5
 * Documentation: write an index (index.rst) and an user guide (usage.rst)
 * Replay script: copy HOME environment for GDB and catch setuid() error
 * fusil-firefox: support more file formats (bmp, gif, ico, png, svg), create
   --test command line option, write the HTML page into index.html file
 * fusil-python: write errors to stderr (instead of stdout) to avoid unicode
   error (especially with Python3)
 * FileWatch: rename the session with "long_output" if the program wrote more
   than max_nbline lines
 * fusil-python: blacklist posix.fork() to avoid false positive
 * If the process is killed by a signal, rename the session using the
   signal name (already worked if the debugger was disabled)

Developer changes:

 * MangleAgent supports multiple input files
 * Create DummyMangle: agent with MangleFile API but don't touch file content
   to test the fuzzer
 * Network: close() method of NetworkClient and ServerClient use
   shutdown(SHUT_RDWR)
 * NetworkServer uses a backlog of 5 clients for socket.listen() (instead of 1)

Bugfixes:

 * Fix Directory.rmtree() and replay script for Python 3.0
 * Fix ServerClient.sendBytes(): use socket.send() result to get the next
   data offset

Fusil 1.1 (2008-10-22)
----------------------

User visible changes:
 * replay.py: ask confirmation if the fuzzer will not be running under a
   different user or as root
 * Even with --force-unsafe, show safety warning if the fuzzer is
   running as the root user
 * Close files for child processes (close_fds=True)
 * Fix directory.rmtree() for Python 3.0 final

Developer changes:
 * Create IntegerRangeGenerator in fusil.unicode_generator
 * Create EnvVarIntegerRange in fusil.process.env
 * Create fusil-wizzard fuzzer
 * Write timestamp in session.log
 * Add session() method to ProjectAgent
 * Add NAME attribute to a fuzzer, reused to choose the project directory name

Bugfixes:
 * Fix Debugger.processSignal(): use the process agent to send the message
   (session_rename) since the debugger agent may be disabled
 * Fix replay.py: quote gdb arguments escape quote and antislash characters
   (eg. "text=\"Hello\\n\".")
 * replay.py uses /dev/null for stdin as Fusil does
 * FileWatch: open file in binary mode to use bytes in Python3

Fusil 1.0 final (2008-09-13)
----------------------------

Visible changes:

 * Create fusil-zzuf fuzzer (use the zzuf library)
 * Create fusil-vlc fuzzer (VLC media player)
 * For each session, generate a Python script (replay.py) to replay the
   session. The script can run the target in gdb, valgrind or gdb.py
   (python-ptrace debugger), with many options (--user, --limit, etc.)
 * Create --force-unsafe option, like --unsafe without the confirmation
 * CreateProcess is now a probe (with a score): if the debugger catchs a
   fatal signal, the session stops
 * Always use a null device as stdin for child processes to avoid blocking the
   fuzzer if the process reads stdin (eg. call getchar())
 * Write the created process identifier in the logs

Developer:

 * Create EnvVarIntegerRange: environment variable with an integer value
   in a fixed range
 * Changes to get a minimal Windows support: disable "change user/group"
   feature on Windows; remove log file before removing the project directory;
   use ":NUL" instead of /dev/null for null input/output
 * On setupProject() error, make sure that the project is cleaned
 * Close stdout files (input and output) at process exit (fix needed
   by Windows)
 * Rename long2raw() to uint2bytes(), and bytes2long() to bytes2uint()
 * Normalize score that make sure that a probe score is in range [-1; +1]
   and so that score*weight is in range[-weight; +weight]
 * CodeC: remove method lines(), writeCode() is renamed writeIntoFile(),
   use unicode strings (instead of byte strings)
 * Remove StdoutFile class, code merged in CreateProcess
